## R Programming Assignment 2: Caching the Inverse of a Matrix

## The makeCacheMatrix function creates a special "matrix",
## which is really a list containing a function to
## 1. set the value of the matrix
## 2. get the value of the matrix
## 3. set the value of the inverse of the matrix
## 4. get the value of the inverse of the matrix
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
        ## @x: a square invertible matrix
        ## return: a list containing functions to
        ##              1. set the matrix
        ##              2. get the matrix
        ##              3. set the inverse
        ##              4. get the inverse
        ##         this list is used as the input to cacheSolve()
        
        inv = NULL
        set = function(y) {
                # use `<<-` to assign a value to an object in an environment 
                # different from the current environment. 
                x <<- y
                inv <<- NULL
        }
        get = function() x
        setinv = function(inverse) inv <<- inverse 
        getinv = function() inv
        list(set=set, get=get, setinv=setinv, getinv=getinv)
}


## The cacheSolve function calculates the inverse of the special "matrix"
## the special "matrix" which created with the makeCacheMatrix function.
## However, it first checks to see if the inverse has already been calculated.
## If so, it gets the inverse from the cache and skips the computation.
## Otherwise, it calculates the inverse of the matrix and sets the value of the inverse
## in the cache via the setinverse function.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## @x: output of makeCacheMatrix()
        ## return: inverse of the original matrix input to makeCacheMatrix()
        
        inv = x$getinv()
        
        # if the inverse has already been calculated
        if (!is.null(inv)){
                # get it from the cache and skips the computation. 
                message("getting cached data")
                return(inv)
        }
        
        # otherwise, calculates the inverse 
        mat.data = x$get()
        inv = solve(mat.data, ...)
        
        # sets the value of the inverse in the cache via the setinv function.
        x$setinv(inv)
        
        return(inv)
}
